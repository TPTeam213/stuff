Ok survivor, you are over halfway to getting the full blueprints back. We recovered a time capsule in the area and added its contents to your data bank, labelled "pattern.jpg" and "link.txt" for your convience. Good luck!

No cipher text was recovered from this region, however the signature was emulating from the time capsule.
